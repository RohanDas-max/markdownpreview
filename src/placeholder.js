    ### And here's some other cool stuff:
    
    Heres some code, `<div></div>`, between 2 backticks.
    
    ```
    // this is multi-line code:
    
    function anotherExample(firstLine, lastLine) {
      if (firstLine == '```' && lastLine == '```') {
        return multiLineCode;
      }
    }
    ```

    Or _italic_.
    Or... wait for it... **_both!_**
    And feel free to go crazy ~~crossing stuff out~~.

    ------------ | ------------- | -------------
    Your content can | be here, and it | can be here....
    And here. | Okay. | I think we get it.
